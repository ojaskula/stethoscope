#Digital stethoscope analog output analyzer

The program is responsible for analyzing the analog audio signal, calculating the BPM and displaying it on the OLED screen.
It was tested on the Raspberry Pi Pico, using a built in ADC converter.

Algorithm works accurately for fairly clear signal. For the noisy signal, the results may be inaccurate.
